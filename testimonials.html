I have a sweet puggle pack of 3 females and they get along marvelously but all have their very unique personalities and roles in their pack. Bella is my very secure oldest gal who really &quot;goes with the flow&quot;. Emmi is the youngest, but definitely likes to be in charge of the group. :-) Maisy, coming from quite a troubled past, has adjusted very well, but is somewhat insecure and has some guarding tendencies. She really prefers that no men enter the house, and that included my husband (now ex). Over 3 years, this problem never resolved and I can only imagine what brought on Maisy&#39;s fear, as she was kept in a cage for the first 4-5 years of her life as a puppy mill breeding dog prior to my rescue-so sad!!!!</p><p>I had worked with another training group to help Maisy to no avail. No amount of super yummy treats or behavioral conditioning made a dent in Maisy&#39;s over-reactive behavior towards men. She never bit anyone, but certainly acted as that was the next step. It made everyone in the house very uncomfortable, and I can only imagine the stress Maisy was feeling. This made me sad for her.</p><p>So, I was lucky enough to meet Lynn at a social event and called upon her help! She came to my home and spent a few hours with me and my girls. While we were just chatting and getting to know each other and she was gathering information about them, she was able to explain clearly to me the goals for each member of my puggle pack. We had some work to do and I was willing to try.</p><p>Lynn even emailed me a very clear and concise training plan the next day which outlined our goals for the program and the steps we would need to take to remedy the problem and prepare Maisy. It was very detailed and she had specific things that I could do right away.</p><p>One goal that I hoped to achieve by hiring Lynn was to ease Maisy&#39;s discomfort around men in general, and especially a special one that she would be meeting very soon that had come into my life recently. I was nervous about what her behavior would be towards him and really wanted everything to go smoothly. This may not have been a &quot;make-or-break-it&quot; situation, but I wanted to do everything in my power to improve things for Maisy.</p><p>Well, with some creative and solid training with Maisy, I am happy to say the meeting with the new man went fabulously. For months prior to their meeting, we got Maisy used to his scent and voice that she would encounter upon his visit. Yes, there were ways to do this prior to the meeting and they were creative!!</p><p>I was so relieved and really owe Lynn so much for helping me to create a safe and loving environment for my Maisy (and the others) while easing the tension I had in anticipation of the meeting. Maisy responded so well, it really shocked me and I was amazed at how well things went.</p><p>Lynn had a wonderful way of caring for my pups, acknowledging their differences (and appreciating them), while helping me understand how all of their interactions with each other affected Maisy&#39;s behavior. She also explained how I could change my own behavior which was contributing to some of Maisy&#39;s insecurities. She explained things clearly and I could tell she really cared for us.</p><p>I cannot say enough good things about Lynn and her approach to training. She is competent, kind and has a heart of gold. I would say she seemed to care about my girls as much as I do.</p><p>Thank you Lynn for all you have done for us!!!</p><ul><li>Amy, Madison, WI</li></ul></article><article id="testimonial-barb-wolter"><img src="/matematica/images/testimonials/barb-wolter.jpg" alt="Barb Wolter"><h2>Downton Abbey &quot;The Wunder Dog&quot; (CGC certified and volunteering)</h2><h3>Basic obedience, family pack structure, CGC certification</h3><p>Abbey came to me by way of divine intervention. I had been a care-giver for my 97 year old father for almost eight months, 24/7, and lost him on Christmas Day, last year. I slipped into a very dark place, not knowing how to begin living again. On January 24th, 2015, Miss Downton Abbey came to me through <a href="http://tracysdogs.com">tracysdogs.com</a>, a San Antonio, TX, dog rescue where she was hours from being euthanized. I chose her from 80 or more dog videos and immediately felt a long-range connection to her. When she arrived, and I held her in my arms the first time, I felt my deceased parents had hand-picked her from above to come and help me begin re-crafting the rest of my life.</p><p>I am a first-time dog owner at 62 years old, living in a 2nd floor condo on the northeast side of Madison. Caring for a little &quot;fur-baby&quot; meant walking up / down 14 steps every time we needed to go out the back door or taking an elevator to go down and out the front floor. And this would be for the rest of our lives together. I quickly realized I needed help to properly guide Abbey to a life of respect, honor and safety. A rescue dog often comes onboard with many fears and anxieties that need to be replaced with leadership and trust. How we &quot;lead by example&quot; determines the quality of life we both will share from the moment we meet.</p><p>Lynn &quot;the Wunder Dog Trainer&quot; Wunderli, came recommended by a dear friend. Lynn’s initial visit was nothing short of genius, her positive interaction and exchange with Abbey was on a level I have never seen experienced. Lynn, was a &quot;dog whisperer.&quot; She connected with Abbey on a whole different level. Lynn quietly called out to me all the behaviors Abbey was demonstrating so that I would learn to &quot;read&quot; Abbey from that day on. How Abbey gazed at me, her submissive behaviors, the licking of her lips when she was anxious, the desire to please as she was learning commands and the choosing to follow what was asked.</p><p>Lynn is a &quot;details oriented&quot; instructor. She had custom tailored a sheet addressing Abbey’s specific behaviors and what I should begin to work on. I immediately put together an &quot;Abbey the Wunder Dog&quot; Notebook where I put all our weekly handouts, and highlighted what our objectives were. We crafted a long-range plan and a short-range plan for what Abbey and I, as a team, hoped to accomplish. Lynn helped me to achieve Abbey’s &quot;Canine Good Citizen&quot; award for discipline and obedience in less then 5 months.</p><p>Lynn is very generous with her time. When she offers instruction for an hour, it turns into way more because she is relationship focused and in my case, took the time to bring to the surface much of the pain I was experiencing in my grief and loss. She told me how easily Abbey would pick up on my emotions and that she would come to be a tremendous comfort in my healing process. Everything Lynn spoke about, became a reality. Abbey, &quot;my little fur-baby Wunder Dog&quot; saved my life and does every day with her tenderness and unconditional love.</p><p>Our dogs have the ability to bring us more joy then any amount of money or tangible reward life has to offer. And once you have the tools and acquired skills, YOU have the ability to forge a lifelong relationship of love and giving.</p><p>Ask Lynn how you can be a part of such an exceptional opportunity with your dog. She is an elite trainer with decades of experience …. and her motto in teaching is &quot;nothing in life comes for free!&quot;</p><p>Allow your dog to perform for you, just exactly what that means!</p><ul><li>Barb Wolter, Madison, WI</li></ul></article><article id="testimonial-ann-b"><img src="/matematica/images/testimonials/ann-b.jpg" alt="Ann B."><p>I&#39;ve known Lynn (and her whole family) long before I got my Rosie, (a neurotic, Polish Lowland Sheepdog that I adopted at age 2 1/2 years). Rosie came with issues, for which Lynn has been a fabulous resource and source of great advice. In addition, Rosie looks fabulous after every grooming. Her hair is a constant challenge and Lynn has risen to the challenge. My dog looks great every time! Rosie is not a dog that can be left anywhere, but Lynn loves her, she is well treated and has adapted well to being part of the Wunderdog family.</p><ul><li>Ann B., Windham, NH</li></ul></article><div class="pure-g pure-type"><div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1"><div class="pure-menu"><hr><p><small>© 2016 Matemática Livre.
