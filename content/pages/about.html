        <h3>Wunderdog's Mission - Since 1998</h3>
        <p>A family business based on trust, knowledge, and integrity...</p>

        <p>Our mission at Wunderdog is to strengthen and improve the relationship between dog and owner. Because we are humans, and dogs are canines, there is (naturally) a gap in our communication! With a better understanding of innate dog behavior, clients benefit and so do their furry family members. We strive to teach all of our clients (young and old) in a way that everyone can understand.</p>

        <p>Wunderdog doesn’t just believe in a client and dog’s education—we believe in continuing our’s too! We are readily attending (and receiving CEU's where available) the latest educational seminars and classes in canine behavior and health, while also maintaining professional-level membership with many accredited canine-based organizations.</p>

        <p>We believe in responsible pet ownership, and support many non-profit rescue and canine service/therapy organizations.</p>

        <p>We offer breed-selection services to clients who are trying to decide on the breed best-suited for their lifestyle and family (this applies to rescues as well!). Because it is <strong>our mission</strong> to improve the lives of both owners and their canine companions, we feel this is a necessary service, and have had great success in our recommendations, placements, and training thereafter.</p>

        <h3>Wunderdog's Philosophy</h3>

        <p>Our philosophy at Wunderdog is based on the humane treatment of animals. It is our belief that all animals deserve respect, understanding, training, and a loving touch.  We know that the in order to achieve success and harmony (especially) with dogs, it is most important to understand their innate behaviors, and to train them to best adapt to our way(s) of human lifestyles.</p>

        <p>We believe in using most training devices, as long as they are used in an efficient, positive, and healthy manner. We research the benefits and/or adverse (physical and mental) effects of the latest training aides, and base our instruction and advise with each dog as an individual (not a "one size fits all").  We offer our knowledge/instruction to our clients, and as an added convenience, supply quality devices at wholesale prices.</p>

        <h3>Lynn Wunderli</h3>
        <h4>Founder &amp; Trainer</h4>
        <p>Owner and President of Wunderdog K-9 Care and Training, LLC, Lynn has been training dogs for over 35 years. Her knowledge and experience with dogs began as a child, because her father was a successful breeder and trainer of English Setters and Pointers for over 55 years (in Illinois). This early exposure in dog behavior and training was supplemented by her college education in teaching and psychology, and her interest and experience in dog training never stopped. Lynn has worked in many settings, volunteering at the University of Illinois Vet School, working at an Animal Emergency Center in Atlanta, GA, and continues to further her education in the field of animal behavior, training and grooming. Lynn has bred and shown Giant Schnauzers, and frequently attends state and national dog shows, allowing her to attend many different types of seminars within the dog field, and specific to many breeds. Working in the continuing education department at the CDC from 1989-1992 allowed Lynn to learn more about communicable disease and public health, which has been helpful in her understanding diseases similar in the canine world, and assessing the risks in canine community environments.</p> 

        <p>Lynn's philosophy is to understand the individual needs and lifestyle and focus training to allow owners an understanding of their dog’s behaviors and the signals dogs give that allow owners and dogs to improve their relationship. Lynn will use ‘whatever works, positively, fairly, and humanely,’ and so will diagnose and offer prognosis through many types of training and devices. She has been working closely with Paws New England since 2009, acting as a temperament evaluator, helping to assess and re-train problematic rescue dogs, this resulting in high success rate in placing these dogs with new owners.</p> 

        <p>Because the ingredients of commercial dog food is key to the health (and sometimes, behavior) of canines, Lynn has done research to find and supply her clients with high quality pet food and Wunderdog includes food delivery in the list of services offered. She has also recently designed a canine fitness program that she has applied to her own dogs, and also offered to her clients. This program has maintained success for over ten years running. Integrating aromatherapy into her daily routine of day damp, grooming and training, Lynn believes that this, as well as massage, these are positive additives to the "daily grind" of canine and owner.</p>

        </ul>

        <p>On a more personal note, Lynn has been married (29 years), and has 5 children. Because Wunderdog is a family oriented/run business, all of Lynn's children are well-versed and educated in dog behavior, and training. Our clients enjoy the fact that their animals are exposed properly to kids and adults of many sizes, and that they see the same folks every time they visit or encounter Wunderdog, whatever the service provided. Lynn's husband, Peter has a PhD in Veterinary Medical Microbiology, and did post-doctoral training at the CDC, in Atlanta, GA. His education and experience in animal diseases, immunology, vaccinology, and pharmaceutical sciences, and particularly in infectious disease control have allowed Wunderdog to apply disease control and has been one of the driving forces in allowing Wunderdog to remain more "disease free" than many of our competitors. 
        Both Chelsea (aged 22), and Madilyn (aged 20) offer exceptional in-home care for Wunderdog clients in the Madison area!</p>

        <p>As personal pets, Lynn and Peter have one Giant Schnauzer (Rocket), a Shih Tzu/Pomerania mix (Napoleon).</p>

        <h3>Peter Wunderli</h3>
        <h4>Co-Founder</h4>
        <p>
            Peter has been one of the foremost reasons Wunderdog has been such a great success. He has always encouraged Lynn to follow her dreams in the animal world, and has always supported and nurtured that. He sits on the board of our business as primary member and co-founder.
        </p>
        <p>
            Peter is a microbial immunologist by education and training, and his post-graduate education includes studies at the UI and UGA Colleges of Veterinary Medicine, with focus on Veterinary Pathobiology and Medical Microbiology. During his position as a visiting researcher at the CDC, in Atlanta, GA, he became involved in rabies vaccine potency testing, and has been an invited speaker at international conferences on rabies and other potency test development topics. When not performing handy-man duties for Wunderdog, he leads a team of scientists involved in developing and applying potency test methods to ensure the quality of biopharmaceutical products.
        </p>
        <p>
            Peter was a driving force in the acquiring of our first Giant Schnauzer, and has fancied the breed ever since. Wunderdog would not exist without Peter Wunderli!

        <h3>Chelsea Wunderli</h3>
        <h4>In-Home Services Provider (routine, training, and vacation)</h4>
        <p>
            Chelsea, 23, has extensive experience in our dog business. She has been involved in our day camp, training, boarding, grooming, and in-home care business since she was 12 years old. Currently Chelsea lives in Madison, and is pursuing her education in nursing. She provides in-home care to Wunderdog clients.
        </p>
        <p>
            Testimony:
            <blockquote>
                Chelsea has been watching Shiner since he was a puppy and has done an amazing job! We utilize in-home services when we travel and routinely during the work week. The service that Chelsea provides allows Shiner to continue his routine at home while also giving him additional training and lots of play time. When we return home after a trip we are guaranteed to find a tidy house and a very happy puppy. We are thrilled with the wonderful service that Chelsea provides and the peace of mind knowing that Shiner is in great hands, whether we are gone for a week or for an afternoon. She continues to be the first person we call when we need in-home puppy care of any kind. We highly recommend her to others.
